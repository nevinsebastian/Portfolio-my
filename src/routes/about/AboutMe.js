      I'm a self-taught web developer and app developer based in Kerala, India. Currently pursuing my B.Tech in Computer Science, I'm also an entrepreneur building a business that requires a robust web and app presence. My development journey revolves around React.js for web development and React Native for app development. With a strong foundation in these technologies, I'm crafting both web and mobile solutions to bring my business to life. My passion for coding and design allows me to create seamless, engaging experiences for users. What sets me apart is my unique blend of technical expertise and a deep understanding of marketing principles. I intuitively grasp how design and functionality work together to drive engagement and conversions. I'm excited to continue this journey and turn my projects into successful digital ventures.
